# Description
. The student record system is used to store the student data in the digital system.The benefit of this system is totally         paperless.It keeps the data at a centralized location.It give access the data anytime.If we authenticate Otp & password encryption it is totally safe.we can search the data through first name,roll no,etc.we can store data permantly.

. We need to handle student records.The main purpose of the project is to build a student database system to facilitate easy access of student's records.we can find the student using search the name.

## Swot Analysis

. Strengths
. The system can provide data in sufficient time.It is suitable for preparing immediate reports.

. Weakness
. Adaption and development are very expensive and time consuming.

. Opportunities
. It can play a controlling role regarding data purity of source systems.
